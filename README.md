# Fairy Light Controller

Initially when we bought [fairy lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I7M7C40/) (sorry for the amazon link, I hope it stays valid for a while) they came with crappy wall warts which had to be plugged and unplugged daily; these wall warts were of such poor quality that the barrel plug which recieved the light strand would inevitably break. 
Totally unacceptable.
The goal of this project is to provide an easy interface for controlling and powering many strands of LED fairy lights.
